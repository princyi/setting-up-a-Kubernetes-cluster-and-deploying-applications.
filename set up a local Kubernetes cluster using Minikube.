##Option 2: Managed Kubernetes Service (e.g., GKE, EKS)

If you prefer to use a managed Kubernetes service, you can follow these steps:

Prerequisites:

A Google Cloud account (for GKE) or an AWS account (for EKS)
The Google Cloud SDK (for GKE) or the AWS CLI (for EKS) installed on your system
Setup GKE:

Create a GKE cluster:
Run the following command to create a GKE cluster:

Edit
Copy code
gcloud container clusters create <cluster-name> --zone <zone>
Replace <cluster-name> with the desired name for your cluster, and <zone> with the desired zone (e.g., us-central1-a).

Get the cluster credentials:
Run the following command to get the cluster credentials:

Edit
Copy code
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --zone <zone>
Verify the cluster:
Run the following command to verify that the cluster is up and running:

Edit
Copy code
kubectl get nodes
This command should display the node details of your GKE cluster.

## Setup EKS: ##

Create an EKS cluster:
Run the following command to create an EKS cluster:

Edit
Copy code
aws eks create-cluster --name <cluster-name> --region <region>
Replace <cluster-name> with the desired name for your cluster, and <region> with the desired region (e.g., us-west-2).

Get the cluster credentials:
Run the following command to get the cluster credentials:

Edit
Copy code
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name> --region <region>
Verify the cluster:
